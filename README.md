# Project title: Crystals Collector / Unit-4-game
 
## Getting Started

This is a project to build Crystals Collector game, where the player will randomly guess numbers hidden behind 4 crystals to sum up to a number the computer has chosen at the start of the game.

### Pre-requisites

Here's how the app works:

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal,when they click one, update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values and the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.


* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
